He says technology becomes so pervasive that it fades into the background even while it creates the world we live in, so definitions matter because they shape what we notice, debate, and try to improve.

This definition includes both ancient tools (e.g., early stone tools) and modern digital systems (e.g., algorithms), and it intentionally doesn\u2019t exclude immaterial or institutional things. ",

He extends this framing to other \u201csocial\u201d technologies (education systems, management consulting) and even controversial examples like marriage, emphasizing that even abstract ideas (e.g., democracy) are instantiated through rules, writing, and systems.
