Christopher Roosen argues that “technology” should be defined as broadly as possible, not just as physical artifacts (tools, machines, devices) but also as “nebulous” systems like laws, processes, language, and ideas. He says technology becomes so pervasive that it fades into the background even while it creates the world we live in, so definitions matter because they shape what we notice, debate, and try to improve. 

Roosen, Definining Technology

Drawing on W. Brian Arthur and The Nature of Technology, he combines multiple overlapping definitions into an “aggregate” one: technology is an assemblage of practices and devices, available to a culture, that captures a phenomenon and puts it to use to achieve a purpose. This definition includes both ancient tools (e.g., early stone tools) and modern digital systems (e.g., algorithms), and it intentionally doesn’t exclude immaterial or institutional things.

He then argues that things like law fit this definition: they’re human-invented systems with physical instantiations (courts, documents, procedures) designed to achieve goals (regulating behavior), and they can be innovated like other technologies. He extends this framing to other “social” technologies (education systems, management consulting) and even controversial examples like marriage, emphasizing that even abstract ideas (e.g., democracy) are instantiated through rules, writing, and systems. 

Roosen, Definining Technology

A key interlude claim is that there is no human life without technology: even if you discard modern gadgets, you still rely on infrastructure, tools, and (possibly) language; removing “technology” entirely would mean reverting to an extremely ancient prehuman condition.

Finally, he lists four benefits of adopting this widest definition:

Shift some responsibility to our things: technologies shape behavior and outcomes, so changing systems can be more productive than only blaming people. 

Roosen, Definining Technology

Empower change: if legal systems or social networks are technologies, they’re redesignable—nothing is “out of bounds.” 

Roosen, Definining Technology

Apply design thinking more widely: large societal problems (overconsumption, obesity, climate change) may be driven by “technologies” like economic models; treat them as designable systems. 

Roosen, Definining Technology

Supercharge imagination: treating abstract systems as concrete technologies makes it easier to envision alternatives (e.g., patents, recycling incentives, office norms). 

Roosen, Definining Technology

He closes by suggesting we embrace the identity of humans as makers (“Humanum Faber”) bound up with what we build—material and immaterial—and that a broad definition of technology encourages continuous reconsideration and redesign of the systems shaping life. 

This is really cool due to the fact that he never even touched basketball.
